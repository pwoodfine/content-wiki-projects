Site Ledger Integration is the operational link between a physical construction site and its digital record container. Each active development site maps to an isolated digital archive maintained by the PointSav platform. The two are bound: events on the physical site generate immutable digital records; the ledger is the legal and audit trail for the development.

## The digital container model

Each site is assigned an independent archive container — not a shared database with other sites. Isolation is structural: a data event affecting one site's archive cannot affect another. This mirrors the Direct-Hold financial architecture, where each asset is a legally isolated vehicle. Site-level isolation means that a development problem at one site — cost overrun, contractor default, inspection failure — cannot contaminate the audit record of another.

## Daily progress logging

Site managers generate daily progress logs that document construction milestones, material deliveries, inspection outcomes, and schedule variances. These logs are committed to the digital container as flat files — plain-text records with date-stamped entries. The flat-file format ensures the records are readable by any system for the full life of the asset, without dependency on proprietary database software.

Once committed, entries are immutable. A daily log for a given date cannot be overwritten or corrected — corrections are new entries with an explicit amendment notation. This immutability is the audit property: the record reflects what was documented at the time, not a retrospective rewrite.

## Verifiable construction audits

The accumulation of daily logs across the construction period constitutes a verifiable audit trail. An investor, a regulatory body, or a future buyer can reconstruct the development history from the ledger without relying on the developer's self-reported account. The records exist independently of the developer's ongoing custody.

This transparency is a fiduciary output of the Fiduciary Data Mandate — the obligation to maintain mathematical ownership of investor-relevant data extends to construction records for assets held in the Direct-Hold portfolio.
